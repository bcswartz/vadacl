# vadacl
vadacl ("validation at domain and component levels") is a code framework for Angular 2 that enhances the reactive form validation features provided in Angular 2.  It provides a means by which developers can set domain/database-based validation rules on data objects but then augment or override those validations as needed within different components.  It also lets developers add and override validation error messages that become part of the validation metadata returned by the validation methods.
